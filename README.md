#Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures üñêÔ∏èüñ±Ô∏è

This project implements a virtual mouse using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to control the cursor and perform mouse actions through hand gestures. It utilizes computer vision techniques to track a user's hand movements via a webcam and detect specific gestures like clicks, double-clicks, and right-clicks. The application is designed for contactless interaction with the system, making it a practical tool for accessibility and creative applications.

Key Features:
Real-time Hand Tracking: Uses MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks.
Gesture-based Mouse Control: Move the cursor and perform various mouse actions using simple hand gestures:
Index Finger Folded: Left-click.
Middle Finger Folded: Right-click.
Thumb-Index Pinch: Double-click.
Customizable and Expandable: Modify gesture detection logic to support additional commands.

Technologies Used:
Python
OpenCV
MediaPipe
PyAutoGUI
NumPy

Usage:
Simply run the script and use your hand gestures in front of the webcam to control the mouse!
